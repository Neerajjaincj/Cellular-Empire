This repository contains an Angular application. Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment, install dependencies, and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Angular application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: You need Node.js to run the Angular development server and manage dependencies. If you don't have it installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately. You can check if npm is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone 'repository-url'

cd 'repository-directory'
```

2. Install project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Project

After you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server and run the Angular application. Use the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will build the application and start a development server. You can access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

By default, the development server will automatically reload the application when you make code changes, allowing you to see the changes in real-time.
